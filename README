# Course Follower

Course Follower is a simple website that will help dartmouth students choose classes by following courses that are currently full and be notified when they become available.

## Overview
Course Follower works by letting students enter their dartmouth email and a class crn. When the course is available they will get an email with a link to where they can sign up for the course.

## Progress
The Frontend is entirely done and supports new email/crn values. 
The Backend needs a little bit more work
The script that gets the current timetable values is totally borked. I know what the post request should be, but can't reliably get the html from the page back.
